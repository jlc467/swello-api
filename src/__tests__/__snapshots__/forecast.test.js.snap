.Synopsis for the southern California coast and Santa Barbara
Channel including the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary
and National Park...At 21z or 2 PM PDT, a 1028 MB surface high was
centered 600 nm west of San Francisco. A 997 MB thermal low was

  "High pressure will remain over the region through the
end of the week...with generally east to southeast winds remaining
in place...becoming onshore near the coast each afternoon. Scattered
to numerous showers and thunderstorms will continue to be the main
concern each day...with gusty winds...locally rough seas...and
frequent lightning possible.",
  "A high pressure ridge just north of the waters will
settle closer to central Florida by late week. This will veer
light onshore winds to a more southerly flow. High moisture levels
will support scattered showers and lightning storms each day.
Conditions will remain mostly favorable for open water navigation,
but locally higher winds and seas will occur near storms.",
